# Winebored
​
We're starting to build out more complex applications with React, time for a recap of everything we've covered today.
​
## Requirements
​
Using the [Winebored API](https://winebored.herokuapp.com) create a site that has the following:
​
* Home page
* Wine INDEX page
* A Navbar for navigating around the site
​
## Tips
​
* Do not just copy and paste the work you have done today. This homework is about understanding not only the syntax, but also the way that all the different parts of the app fit together.
* Do not just copy each file from top to bottom, as you will import components that you have not yet built, which will cause bugs.
* Think about the order in which to build things, make sure you are creating your components in a logical and pragmatic way.
* Favour creating larger components to check that things are working correctly _before_ splitting them into smaller components.


`yarn start` to run the development server

`yarn build` to create a build directory


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
